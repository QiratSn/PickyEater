# PickyEater

PickyEater is an application that will be able to decide on a restaurant amongst a group. 

The application is meant to simplify the decision-making process and present the user with a restaurant option they can enjoy. The app is targeted to young adults living in cities. This is because cities often have a plethora of restaurant options to choose from and young adults are often eating out in groups, either with friends or colleagues, rather than at home with their families. We have found that deciding on a restaurant amongst a group can be tedious because everyone has different ideas, and the options are endless. After embarking on some research, we have found that even psychology studies support the idea that the more options a person has, the more difficult/less satisfying the decision will be. We aim to solve this problem by having our app decide on the restaurant. First, the user will create an account and add the names of their favorite restaurants or restaurants they want to try in the future, to their account. Then the user will connect with friends who also have an account and create groups with them. When the group wants to go out to eat, the users will open the app and apply a filter preference. Preferences include options such as: price range, food type (Italian, Mexican, Moroccan, etc..), and location. Finally, the app will process these preferences from each group member and output the restaurant the users should go to and enjoy.
